## TL; DR
Ang **Data Types**, from the name itself, ay ang pagsasabi kay computer kung anong *type* ang nararapat sa isang data. For example, credit card numbers could be an **Integer data type** or **String data type**, user name most of the time should be a **String data type**, and crushBaAkoNiCrush should be `true`, a **Boolean data type**.

## Overview
A data type is a classification of data which tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data.

The most common data types were **String**, **Integer**, **Boolean**, **Floats/Floating point**, and **nothing/None/null value**.

## Further chika
Understanding and fully grasping data types is a very important skill, because a major part of understanding how to design a program/application or code them revolves in understanding the types of data that we want to work with, and how to process or work with that data.

In the IT Field, we process information daily using computer systems and other technology. Before we can even have meaning information, we first need to process raw **data**.
>**Data** can be defined as a representation of facts, concepts, or instructions in a formalized manner, which should be suitable for communication, interpretation, or processing by human or electronic machine.
>**Data** is represented with the help of characters such as alphabets (A-Z, a-z), digits (0-9) or special characters (+,-,/,*,<,>,= etc.) [(source)](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_fundamentals/computer_data.htm)

Raw **Data** could be anything that is useful: username, password, employee number, address, email address, phone number, etc.

Now now, kalmahin muna natin sarili natin sa kaka-english, basic lang to mga aports. Ang bawat **Data** na meron tayo comes in different forms like your **name** is a **string** of characters, your **age** is usually an **integer**, or ang pera mo sa wallet usually **integer** or kapag may sentimos ka or decimals naman ay **floats**.

**Common Data Types:**

| Data Type | Represents | Examples |
| --------- | ---------- | -------- |
| `integer` | whole numbers | `1`, `1000`, `0`, `-10` |
| `floating point` | fractional numbers | `-123.4`, `80.5`, `3.14` |
| `string` | a sequence of characters | "Hello Crush!" |
| `Boolean` | logical `true` or `false` | `true` `false` |
| `nothing` `None` `null` | no data | `null` |


These common data types usually exist in most programming languages and act or behave similarly from language to language. Additionally, may mga composite and/or complex data types sa iba't ibang language na dapat rin naman natin alamin if we're studying a particular language. e.g. **Set** and **Map** type in **Javascript**, **Dictionary** **Tuple** and **List** type in **Python**, **Double** in **Java**.

Example pseudocode:

```
	DECLARE integer variable sum
	DECLARE float variable percentage
	DECLARE string phrase
	DECLARE boolean bool
	
	ASSIGN sum = 42
	ASSIGN percentage = 0.20
	ASSIGN phrase = "edi don't"
	ASSIGN bool = true
```

## Summary para di na sumakit ulo mo
Simply put, in order to produce meaningful information, we need to process **data**, and the first step is to take account what **type** of **data** we will be working with.

- **Data Types**  are different types of data we intend to use (duhhhh).
- **Data Types** have different purposes
- **Data Types** represent different values

***ON THE NEXT EPISODE OF PROGRAMMING FUNDAMENTALS:***

So maybe some (or most) of you is still confused or wondering kung bakit kailangan natin ma-fully understand ang **data types**, one reason is because **data types** majorily influences the design and intent of our code. On the next lesson we will deep dive further into one of the important concept when designing code (at least for me hehe) that will definitely boost your understanding in programming.
