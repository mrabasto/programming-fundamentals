## TL; DR
**Code blocks** are compound statements, or valid code that was grouped together. So in simple terms, grupo lang to ng codes mo sa isang application na maaring related ang ginagawa towards each other.

## Overview
A code block, sometimes referred to as a compound statement, is a lexical structure of source code which is grouped together. Blocks consist of one or more declarations and statements. [(source)](https://press.rebus.community/programmingfundamentals/chapter/code-blocks/)

## Further chika
Very simple lang to mga lodi. Basically ang *code blocks* kagaya nang nabanggit sa itaas ay grupo ng *statements* or valid code sa isang programming language, na maaring related ang kani-kanilang purpose o ginagawaa. 

Let's take a look at the an `if` statement example:

```javascript
	// This is an example of an if statement in JavaScript:
	// Usually our if statement has three (3) parts:  
	// the if-keyword
	// an expression that produces a Boolean value
	// and the code block or body
	
	if(true){
		// do something here in the body
		// like declaring a variable or any other computation
		let myVariable = "Hello World!"
	}
```


Above is an example of an `if` statement in JavaScript. JavaScript identifies a code block using curly braces `{}`. In Python, a code block is identified through indentation or tabs.

```python
if True:
	# do something here in the body
	myVariable = "Hello World!"
```

## Summary para di na sumakit ulo mo
Here is a list of things na dapat tandaan when it comes to code blocks:

1. **Code blocks** were usually independent from each other. Which means, hindi nila alam ang mga pangyayari sa bawat isa.
2. You can do almost all valid operations like variable declaration and assignment, arithmetic computations, creating control structures like `if` statements inside a **code block**.
3. In an `if` statement, not all code blocks will run, only those that have their conditions met.
