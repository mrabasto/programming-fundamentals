## TL; DR
Ang **Control Structures** ay feature ng isang programming language which allows the program to perform different process or actions depending on what is needed during the execution of the program. We have two (2) common control structure **if control structure** and **case control structure**.

## Overview
In selection **control structures**, conditional statements are features of a programming language which perform different computations or actions depending on whether a programmer-specified Boolean condition evaluates to true or false.

## Further chika
This is just a very simple concept so without further ado, bi-basican lang muna natin ang mga bagay bagay. Let's start with the `if` statement.

**IF STATEMENT**

```
	// Here's the very obvious pattern pagdating sa if statements
	// Most of the programming language na may selection control structure
	// ganito ang pattern ng if statement
	
	if <condition>
		<body / block of codes>
	else
		<body / block of codes>
	end
	
	// So kagaya ng sinabi natin kanina, most of the programming language
	// na maaring ma-encounter nyo is ganito ang format/pattern
```

Above is a pseudocode showing an example of an `if` statement. Basically, ang nangyayari dito is, mayroon tayong `condition` which is any expression na nagreresult sa isang `Boolean` value, `true` or `false`. Kung ang `condition` natin ay nagresult as `true`, mag-rarun ang blocks of codes natin na nakapaloob sa `if` statement natin.

```
	// We can also add another branch of the if statement
	
	if <condition>
		<body>
	else if <condition>
		<body>
	else
		<body>
	end
	
	// using an 'else if' statement
```

Above example shows multi-way `if` statement na kung saan maraming paths ang maaring puntahan ng ating program execution based sa ating `condition`. Another important thing to take note is paano nag-rarun ang ating program through this `if` statement.

```
	// our program runs from top to bottom
	// so from top to bottom isa isang ini-evaluate ng ating program
	// ang bawat condition sa ating if statement
	
	if <condition>		<- This condition gets evaluated first, if this results to false it will jump to the next if or else if statement
		<body>
	else if <condition>	<- This condition will be evaluated if the condition above is false
		<body>
	else				<- If none of the condition above is false, the else block will run
		<body>
	end
	
	// from top to bottom, whichever condition results to true first
	// its body will run, then mag end na kaagad yung if statement
```


**SWITCH CASE STATEMENT**

Ang **Switch or Case** statement is another form of selection control structure na maari nating gamitin to introduce choices of paths within our programs. **Switch or Case** statement compare a given value with specified constants and take action according to the first expression to match. [(source)](https://press.rebus.community/programmingfundamentals/chapter/selection-control-structures/)


```
	// Here's the pattern na madalas mong maeencounter
	// in different programming languages
	
	switch <value>
		case CONSTANT_1:
			<body>
			break
		case CONSTANT_2:
			<body>
			break
		case CONSTANT_3:
			<body>
			break
		default:
			<body>
			break
	
	// As we can see almost same mechanics lang din ito compared
	// sa if statement. So which one should you use?
	// For me, kung mas papasimplehin natin ang iyong code at mas mabilis mong mababasa
	// then go for that approach
